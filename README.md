# geometrical-curve-comparison

This repository provides a Lua implementation of the curve comparison algorithm originally developed for my [Xray Training App](https://xray-training-app.vercel.app/).
The algorithm measures similarity between user-drawn traces and reference paths by resampling and computing distance metrics.
